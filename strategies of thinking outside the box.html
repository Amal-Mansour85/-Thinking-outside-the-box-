  <h1 class = "title">9 STRATEGIES  THAT  WILL  HELP  YOU  THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX</h1>




<div>
       <ol class="text">

       	<li> Be aware of what's going on outside <br></li>
       	<img src="orbit.gif" alt="nature" height="300px" width="500px">
       		<p>It’s common to see international markets being a step ahead with the next big thing. Because of this, you need to pay attention to everything that is happening around the world. 

Watching the news, reading the paper and traveling abroad are all great way to keep in the loop and to come across ideas that can be used in your own daily life and applied to your market back home.     </p>


              <li> Read more <br></li>
              <center>
               <iframe width="500px" height="300px" src="cat read.MP4" alt="a cat"></iframe>
           </center>
 <p>Are you in the habit of reading? 
This is a practise that gets creativity going to a whole new level. And we’re not just talking about scientific journals or business material. It could be any genre that fits your fancy. Reading opens doors and leaves you more observant, analytical and intelligent.

Therefore, to think outside the box, try reading more. Take advantage of your free time and dig into some good fiction, a thriller, poetry, biographies or self-development books. It’ll make a difference in your day to day!<br></p>


        	   <li> Try something new<br></li>
        	   <img src="history channel jump GIF by HISTORY UK - Find & Share on GIP.gif" alt="airplain">
 	<p>Always doing the same old same old leaves your brain unstimulated. This is completely normal, and why we are always led to solve problems the safest way possible. 

Our tip is to push yourself to try something new at least once a week. Let your imagination run wild! There’s a whole world of possibilities waiting for you, like a new place to grab some exoitic grub, try your hand at a radical sport, learn about a new location on the globe  or test the waters of a new film genre.  

This is all food for the famished mind. Not only because it will broaden your horizons, but it will help you find new solutions to old, nagging problems. <br> </p>


        	 	<li>Invest in networking<br></li>
        	  	<img src="networking.gif" alt="person">
        	 
  <p>Networking is an important tool for those who’d like to think outside the box. It makes you get out there and have conversations, build relationships, and exchange experiences with folks from different areas and backgrounds.   

The more people you know, the more business opportunities you’ll have. A good digital influencer, or even more so, a content creator should be rubbing shoulders with journalists, business owners, musicians, architects and even lawyers.    

Keep in mind that all of these kinds of people can enrich your day to day and help open your eyes to new ideas. There’s always something new another person can teach you, isn’t that right?<br></p>
       		   

       		      <li> Use mental maps<br></li>
       		      <img src="mental map.gif" alt="head">
   <p>	Mental maps are just what the doctor ordered for those suffering from an uncreative, unorganized mind. You can’t always sit around idly waiting for your next big idea to strike you!

You need to stimulate your mind and help it make the needed connections to come up with an innovative solution. Give more importance to this resource, which, in the end, is nothing more than a diagram of ideas.  <br></p>  


                   <li>Be more observant<br></li>
                   	<img src="be more observent.gif" alt="animal">
    <p>The ability of being observant is an indispensable element for thinking outside the box. It allows you to gain valuable insight, helping you see the root problem and the ideal solution.  

So many times we are unable to overcome obstacles because we don’t fully understand them or even see them. But with a little more observation it’s possible to think more strategically, innovatively, and with more efficiency. <br></p>


                   	<li>Leave negativity behind<br></li>
                   		<img src="negativity.gif" alt="a men" height="200px" width="500px">
                   		<p>When you think about your problems in a pessimistic way, you suffer brain blockage of what should be creativity flowing. 

To get the creative juices going, you need to think more on the bright side and abandon negativity. Always remember that a healthy mind is a source of great ideas and guarantees a happier life to be lived.  

Letting negative thoughts take over creates vicious cycles and stops you from moving forward. Because of this, no matter how hard the situation gets, don’t lose your enthusiasm and focus on better solutions. <br></p>


                    <li>don't take your time for rest and meditation for granted<br></li>
                    	<img src="meditation.gif" alt="three person">
   	<p>One of the biggest problems among professionals these days is a lack of time to relax and meditate. Work is important, but it can’t compromise your quality of life and your well-being. 

Set aside a part of your day to unwind and meditate and make sure your mind and body are ready for the challenges ahead. True success is only reached when we are at peace. After all, the best ideas rely on a healthy mind.   </p>


               <li>Tap into your subconscious<br></li>
            	<img src="mental map.gif" alt="head">
   	<p>Finally, we’d like to give you a technique that can help a lot to get the creative gears oiled up. It’s something known as freefall writing, and it can help your reach into your subconscious for new solutions.</p>
