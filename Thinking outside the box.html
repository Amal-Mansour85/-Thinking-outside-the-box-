	 		<li>change your life for the better :<br></li>
<p>The world can become very small if you’re close-minded. Thinking outside the box can expand your worldview, allowing you to have greater perspective on the events and happenings in your career (and in life). When you’re willing to consider alternative points of view and ways of doing things, you’ll be more open to a variety of different points of view and potential solutions.

A greater perspective can make you more receptive to different ideas, which means that you won’t be limited by a small worldview. When you’re open to limitless possibilities, the possibilities are endless!.<br></p>


                  <li>Taking advantage of business opportunities :<br></li>
<p>There are entrepreneurs who are content and comfortable, and those who are restless and always thirsty for something new. The former can make money, but rarely grow and become icons of their industries. 

The truth of the matter is that those who think outside the box are better at taking advantage of opportunities within the market. That’s why when they wager on a trend before anyone else, they end up ahead of the rest due to consumer preference.<br></p>



             <li>Higher-quality work :<br></li>
                
<p>uper-successful companies have a different approach to company culture. For instance, consider the fashion retailer Zappos. It offers employee perks like free food, complimentary wellness services and even an on-site shoeshine service.

On the one hand, it would be easy to dismiss these things as a waste of money and a threat to the company’s bottom line. However, they take the long view. They see that by offering these benefits and perks, they attract and retain better employees. Happy and healthy employees tend to be more productive, loyal and harder-working.

By thinking outside the box with their company culture, they ultimately get a better caliber of employee and work, which makes it well worth the expenditure they put out with these offerings.<br></p>



                        <li>More creative in problem-solving :<br></li>
<p>When you’re thinking in the box as opposed to outside of it, your career growth can be stunted. When there are a finite number of ways that things can be done also means that there is a limit to what you can achieve.

Alternatively, when you think outside the box, suddenly there are many more possibilities and opportunities. When you allow for any and every possible solution, you may in fact end up coming up with more creative ways to solve problems.

Consider Netflix, for instance. By dreaming up an alternative to the standard video store template with rentals and late fees, they were able to create a worldwide sensation. What creative solutions could you come up with if you think outside the box?<br></p>




                           <li> Stay adaptables: <br></li>
              <p>Whether you’re a writer, a trader or the founder of a food truck, one thing is certain: Your career will change over time. Technology, people’s tastes and all sorts of other factors are constantly evolving, and you’ll need to be able to change in kind to remain relevant.

For example, as a teacher, I have to constantly keep evolving to remain current. If I didn’t evaluate and alter my techniques with the changing times, I’d quickly become a dinosaur in my field.

Perhaps one of the most profound effects of thinking outside the box is that it will help you stay adaptable. Your mind won’t be closed off to new ideas or solutions or situations, and therefore you’ll be better able to navigate the ever changing landscape of business.<br></p>
